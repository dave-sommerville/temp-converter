# JavaScript Exercise: Night Mode and Temperature Conversion

This is my first web app with JavaScript linked. A basic exercise in Query Selectors, inputs, buttons, and css adaptation. Will be adding night mode to other projects soon. Likely won't add too much to this project going forward. 


## Features
- Header with live links to my contact information
- Temperature Converter for both Celsius and Fahrenheit
- Night Mode toggle switch fixed at bottom of page
